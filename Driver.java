         * Guest Room: A room filled with numerous torture devices. Who said anything about welcome guests? :: Kitchen
         * Library: Better version of the study. It has all of the different books that one may want. Make sure that you stay quiet or the mean librarian will slap you! :: Holodeck, Trophy Room, Study
         * Kitchen: This amazing culinary art studio has it all: cheese cellar, wine racks, and a 16 stove burner. With its pizza oven, it makes for the perfect Italian getaway. :: Study, Guest Room
         * Study: Do you love being disturbed while working? This room has it all. It is the central hub to the whole house. It has a giant wall of computers and amazing lighting, but doors that exit out into numerous different rooms. :: Kitchen, Library, Bedroom
         * Holodeck: A room that can disguise itself in a variety of ways. Experience a lush, humid rainforest, a speakeasy of the 1920â€™s, or the dungeons of Cooper Library. :: Library
         * Trophy Room: Spacious room with oak wood as far as the eye can see, shelves filled to the brim with trophies and obscure collections, it really makes you wonder who they belong to. :: Bedroom, Library
         * Bedroom: A lavished bed adorns the center of this room, with long curtains, beautiful rugs, and gilded furniture acting as little details to truly make this a great bedroom. :: Study, Trophy Room
